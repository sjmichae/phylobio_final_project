# Phylogenetic Biology - Final Project

## Guidelines - you can delete this section before submission

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it, develop your project, and submit it as a pull request. Edit/ delete the text in this readme as needed.

Some guidelines and tips:

- Use the stubs below to write up your final project. Alternatively, if you would like the writeup to be an executable document (with [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), [jupytr](http://jupyter.org/), or other tools), you can create it as a separate file and put a link to it here in the readme.

- For information on formatting text files with markdown, see https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ . You can use markdown to include images in this document by linking to files in the repository, eg `![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)`.

- The project must be entirely reproducible. In addition to the results, the repository must include all the data (or links to data) and code needed to reproduce the results.

- If you are working with unpublished data that you would prefer not to publicly share at this time, please contact me to discuss options. In most cases, the data can be anonymized in a way that putting them in a public repo does not compromise your other goals.

- Paste references (including urls) into the reference section, and cite them with the general format (Smith at al. 2003).

- Commit and push often as you work.

OK, here we go.

# Using Phylogeny to Understand Magnesium Ion Channels

## Introduction and Goals

The goal of my project is to examine magnesium transport in the human body using phylogeny by comparing human magnesium ion channels to other ion channel families and to other methods of magnesium transport in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. A guiding question is thus whether human magnesium ion channels share greater homology with other human ion channels or other magnesium transport mechanisms.

The methods I will use to do this are...

The data I will use are (my own data/ data publicly available at YYY/ simulations)

## Methods
This project consists of two main branches. The first branch uses protein sequence data to look at magnesium ion channels in Homo sapiens. Protein data is superior to DNA and RNA data in this instance because the channels operate at the protein level. We do not need to think about the relative importance of coding and noncoding DNA regions. Moreover, amino acids convey information in fewer letters than their corresponding DNA codons and avoid dealing with the degeneracy of the DNA code.

A second branch of the project uses morphological data as a proof of principle to analyze ion channel phylogeny. 
The mantra of biology that structure determines function rings true.
A shortcoming of protein data is that it only allows us to examine the primary structure of the ion channels
